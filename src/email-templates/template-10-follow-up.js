Following up on my message about [ORIGINAL_TOPIC] for [COMPANY_NAME].

I know you're busy, so I'll keep this brief: we just helped [RECENT_SUCCESS_COMPANY] achieve [RECENT_RESULT], and the approach could work well for your team too.

If timing isn't right now, no worries â€” but if you'd like to explore this, I'm happy to share a quick overview.

Just reply with "interested" or "not now" and I'll respect your preference.

Thanks,
[SENDER_NAME]
